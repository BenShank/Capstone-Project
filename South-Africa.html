  <h2>More information on South Africa</h2>
 <p>South Africa is located in, you guessed it, Africa. Poaching has been going on for a long time but in the past few decades it has aroused in to a big problem. Poaching in south Africa has been going on since the late 1960’s the rhino population was at an all time low in 1968 with as little as 1,800 white rhinos left. Now it has increased up to 20,000. This became a problem in the early in 1960’s when the rhino population was at an all time low there have been many laws put in place to ban the illegal removing of animals. 
Effects on the land economically it can have a positive effect because the selling of furs horns and tusks bring money into the country yes it is dirty illegal money it still is money. Did you know one rhino horn in a global market and cost up to $30,000!?  But in the other hand this can have many negative effects say if the tiger population is extinct or very low then the herbivores will uncontrollably eat the grass making it inhabitable. Or if the elephant population sharply declines then the the grass will thrive and the population of tigers will lose a main part of their diet. The social  effect is that the people be suspicious and turn on their friends family etc this would make South Africa a “war zone”when they could team up and fight the poachers.</p>
