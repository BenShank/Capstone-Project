  <h2>Global solution</h2>
  <p>global solution is the whole world can crack down on global markets selling the illegal goods a rhino horn in a global market can cost up $30,000 so if the global anti poaching organizations can find their markets and store-houses they can take a big profit chunk out of the poachers business.</p>
  <h2>National solution</h2>
<p>A national solution is to better train the National Park ranger so they can handle the situation when they come up like when a poacher is spotted from a long distance. Also you can hire more park rangers to help locate the poachers then have the more skilled rangers talk them out. </p>
