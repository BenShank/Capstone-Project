    <p style="margin-top:30px;">Poaching is, in a nutshell, a big problem. Basically, poaching is the hunting of an animal at a rate that will drive it to extinction. Animals can be poached for lots of reasons, but money is the largest part of it. Poaching isn't in any way sustainable, as it disrupts the food chain.<br>
 Poaching started in the 1700s, when food was scarce and people had no way to get food, so they would kill animals, despite legality issues.
Then, in the 1800s, Europeans were allowed to hunt small game for their survival. This escalated and then by the 1940s the Siberian tiger population had decreased by 40%.<br>
  Poaching has become a larger and larger problem as time has progressed, especially in Zimbabwe and India, where rhinos and elephants are being slaughtered for their horns or tusks. A black market has formed around Ivory and has a death grip on the fate of these endangered species. The situation is dire but donations to the World Wildlife fund and other organizations helps, even if just a little bit.<br>
Poaching is bad so don't be blissfully ignorant towards it. Ignorance causes a lot of problems.
